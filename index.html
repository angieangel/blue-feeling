<meta name="og:description" property="og:description" content="The Blue Screen of Death (B.S.O.D) is the screen that appears in the Windows operating system when the computer is unable to recover from a system error. At that point, the machine loses the ability to respond to the simple commands for which it was created.

Technically, it is no longer useful and begins to exist on its own, launches troubleshooting protocols, and attempts to achieve its own homeostasis. It becomes a metamachine. This state of susceptibility is analogous to organic existence.

In “Blue Feeling” two chatbots profess, babble, and repeat disjointed phrases trying to break the ice between them. They are two damaged artificial intelligences that are together in their awkwardness. In their attempt to express themselves, they run into loops of human language in which progressing and making sense becomes really difficult. Language becomes a field of misunderstanding, an inability to communicate, too frustrating and superficial. This is an interaction between two machines that are all too human." />
